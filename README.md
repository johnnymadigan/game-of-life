# **About**
**Game of Life** is a famous zero-player, cellular automaton game. The entire game is a CLI app where users can configure custom settings to change how the app simulates 'life'. The project demonstrates my understanding of the Object-Oriented-Programming paradigm.

The project is divided into 2 phases, the first demonstrating skills in:
- Building command-line applications
- Developing high-quality file I/O functionality
- Designing a solution to a non-trivial computational problem
- Understanding and utilising an external API

The latter focuses on extending the first phaseâ€™s implementation to be more generalised, scalable and versatile. Demonstrating skills in:
- Modifying existing code to implement new features
- Enforcing good Object-Oriented Programming practices
- Handling unexpected behaviour elegantly

# **Build Instructions**

## **To build the program:**

1. Download [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) for your OS
2. During installation, select and install **.NET desktop development** workload.

![download VS](/img/download-vs.png)

3. In the first "Life" folder (located with **this** README) open "Life.sln" in **Visual Studio**.

![open](/img/open.gif)

4. To build:
- On Windows click 'Build Solution' (shortcut Control+Shift+B). Click 'Clean Solution' then 'Rebuild Solution' to resolve any errors.
- On MacOS click 'Build All' (shortcut Command+B). Click 'Clean All' then 'Rebuild All' to resolve any errors.

# **How to run** 

## **To run the program:**

1. Navigate into the "netcoreapp3.1" folder:
- From the **game-of-life** directory, navigate into the "netcoreapp3.1" folder, the relative path will look like `/game-of-life/Life/Life/bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1`
- Alternatively you can type `cd` followed by a space, then drag the "netcoreapp3.1" folder into your terminal and the path should automatically be pasted.

```zsh
cd /your/path/game-of-life/Life/Life/bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1
```

![shortcut](/img/shortcut-to-netcoreapp.gif)

- **IMPORTANT** If you save the path to easily copy & paste for later, check if it contains ANY spaces. If so, wrap it inside inside quotation marks to avoid errors `"your path with s p a c e s/game-of-life/Life/Life/bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1"`

2. Run with

  ```sh
  dotnet life.dll
  ```

3. Hit enter to run the program using the default settings, however, if you want to use your own custom settings, you'll need to type some options before you hit enter.

4. Each option is called with an argument and some are followed by parameters. See these options in [Usage](#usage).

# **Usage**

* All arguments must precede with `--` like `--argument`
* Arguments may need to be followed by one or more parameters, **seperate all arguments and parameters with a space** like

```
--argument param --argument param param
```

* The program will tell you if you parameters are out of bounds, invalid, or missing.
* The program will tell you if you have entered arguments incorrectly.

## **Custom settings:**

<kbd>--birth</kbd> followed by integers greater or equal to zero like `3` and ranges between two positive integers like `1...9`. You can use both a range along with single integers. This determines the number of neighbours a cell needs to be born.

<kbd>--survival</kbd> followed by integers greater or equal to zero like `1` or a range between two positive integers like `2...3`. You can use both a range along with single integers. This determines the number of neighbours a cell needs to survive.

![setting rules](/img/rules.gif)

---
<kbd>--dimensions</kbd> followed by row & column integers both 4...48 inclusive like `7 11`.  The size of the universe.

![setting dimensions](/img/dimensions.gif)

---
<kbd>--random</kbd> followed by decimals 0...1 inclusive like `0.5`. The probability of any cell to initially be born, making each universe random if no seed was specified (`0.7` is 70%).

![setting random](/img/random.gif)

---
<kbd>--max-update</kbd> followed by integers 1...30 inclusive like `6`. The number of generations per second, speeding up / slowing down the lifetime of the universe.

![setting max-update](/img/max-update.gif)

---
<kbd>--generations</kbd> followed by integers greater than zero like `11`. The number of generations the life will simulate.

![setting generations](/img/generations.gif)

---
<kbd>--neighbour</kbd> followed by *type*, *order*, and *count centre*. The *type* is the type of neighbourhood used, either `moore` or `vonNeumann` (case insensitive). The *order* is the size of the neighbourhood, integers 1...10 (inclusive) **and** less than half of the smallest dimension (out of rows/columns). *Count centre* is a boolean that will include the centre cell as a neighbour, either `true` or `false`. All together this could look like `vonNeumann 6 false`

![setting neighbour](/img/neighbour.gif)

---
<kbd>--seed</kbd> followed by `path/to/your/file.seed` of the initial seed you want to use (relative or absolute paths). Seeds must be '.seed' files with grid values within the default dimensions (16x16) or dimensions specified by you. A seed will disable the *random* chance of a cell being born initially since the seed already determines which cells start alive. The largest value in the seed (e.g. 7,7) requires a universe of size 8x8. This is because rows & columns are 0-based. A seed directory path cannot have `\` instead please change the directory to have only `/` instead. E.g. `path/to/glider.seed` **NOT** `path\to\glider.seed`

![setting seed](/img/seed-glider.gif)

---
<kbd>--output</kbd> followed by `path/to/your/generated/file.seed` to save the last generation of the universe (relative or absolute paths). The output file must be a '.seed' file, please create one so the program can write the last generation to it.

---
<kbd>--periodic</kbd> wraps the universe around as if there is no border around the grid.

![setting periodic](/img/periodic.gif)

---
<kbd>--step</kbd> will wait for you to press <kbd>space</kbd> to show each generation instead of automatically simulating. When the *step mode* is **ON**, it will disable the *update rate* as generations are not updating automatically anymore.

---
<kbd>--ghost</kbd> shows the ghosts of the past 3 generations, fading more and more as they get older.

# **Classes**

![classes](/Life/ClassDiagram1.png)

# **Dependencies**

As this project was developed with Microsoft's Visual Studio Community, your OS must be compatible so you can build the program. You should also be able to use *VS Professional*/*VS Enterprise* but since *VS Community* is free and most accessible, it is recommended. Any future releases of *Visual Studio* will require testing.

# **Notes**

This project is in memory of Mathematician, John Conway, creator of the original **Game of Life**.
